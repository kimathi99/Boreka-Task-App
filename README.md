# Boreka-React-Native-Coding-Test.
A simple React Native app that lets users keep track of tasks. The user should be able to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view a list of all tasks. When a task is added or completed, the app should collect the user's current location (latitude and longitude) and store it with the task.
